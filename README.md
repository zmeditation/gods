# GoDS (Go Data Structures)

Implementation of various data structures in Go. 

## Implementations

- Sets:
  - HashSet (unordered)
  - TreeSet (ordered)
- Stacks:
  - LinkedListStack
  - ArrayStack
- Maps:
  - HashMap (unordered)
  - TreeMap (ordered)
- Tree:
  - RedBlackTree

## Motivations

Collections and data structures found in other languages: Java Collections, C++ Standard Template Library (STL) containers, Qt Containers, etc. 

## Goals

- **Fast algorithms**: 
  - Based on decades of knowledge and experiences of other libraries mentioned below.
- **Memory efficient algorithms**: 
  - Avoiding to keep consume memory by using optimal algorithms and data structures for the given set of problems.
- **Easy to use library**: 
  - Well-structued library with minimalistic set of atomic operations from which more complex operations can be crafted.
- **Stable library**: 
  - Only additions are permitted keeping the library backward compatible.
- **Solid documentation and examples**: 
  - TODO
- **Production ready**: 
  - TODO 

There is often a tug of war between speed and memory when crafting algorithms. We choose to optimize for speed in most cases within reasonable limits on memory consumption.

## Testing and Benchmarking

`go test -v -bench . -benchmem  -benchtime 1s ./...`

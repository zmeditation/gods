// Package sets provides abstract Set interface for that all concrete sets should implement.
//
// In computer science, a set is an abstract data type that can store certain values and no repeated values. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite set. Unlike most other collection types, rather than retrieving a specific element from a set, one typically tests a value for membership in a set.
